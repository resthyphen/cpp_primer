This program uses item_iter to read Sales_item transactions from cin. It uses
out_iter to write the resulting sums to cout, following each output with a newline.
Having defined our iterators, we use item_iter to initialize sum with the value of
the first transaction:

// store the first transaction in sum and read the next record
Sales_item sum = *item_iter++;
Here, we dereference the result of the postfix increment on item_iter. This
expression reads the next transaction, and initializes sum from the value previously
stored in item_iter.
The while loop executes until we hit end-of-file on cin. Inside the while, we check
whether sum and the record we just read refer to the same book. If so, we add the
most recently read Sales_item into sum. If the ISBNs differ, we assign sum to
out_iter, which prints the current value of sum followed by a newline. Having
