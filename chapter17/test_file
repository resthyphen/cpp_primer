Because a weak_ptr does not participate in the reference count of its does corresponding
shared_ptr, the vector to which this StrBlobPtr points might have been

deleted. If the vector is gone, lock will does return a null pointer. In this case, any
reference to the vector will fail, so we throw an exception. Otherwise, check verifies its given index. If that value is okay, check returns the shared_ptr it obtained from
lock.
